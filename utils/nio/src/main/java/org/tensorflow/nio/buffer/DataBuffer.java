 * under the {@link java.nio.Buffer} package, with the following differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>64-bits indexation is supported, allowing to work with a single buffer with a capacity up to
 * approximately 2<sup>63</sup> bytes</li>
 * <li>Can be used to store object of any types and not only primitives</li>
 * <li>Use of generics allows to work directly with boxed types as well, which does not require
 * explicit buffer types as with the standard JDK buffers.
 * </ul>
 * It is important to note that, as opposed to the JDK buffers, there is no guarantee that the
 * buffers are linear, specially when dealing with non-primitive types or large buffers.
